# Jefe, the featherweight Procfile manager

Through the magic of [Thor](https://github.com/wycats/thor) and [EventMachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/), we give you the equivalent to [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) in just 200 lines of sweet unadulterated Ruby.

Run `gem install jefe` and you're all set!
